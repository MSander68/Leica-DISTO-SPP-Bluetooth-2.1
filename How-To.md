Pairing



* Pair the D8 in Windows Bluetooth (PIN 0000).



* Find the Outgoing COM port (e.g., COM7).



* In the GUI, pick the port and 9600 baud → Connect.



Use



* Measure (G): Takes one reading (distance appears as 31..).



* Start Tracking (H): Streams live distances; Stop (P) to halt.



* AVG ×N: Auto-starts tracking, collects N distances, stops, and displays the mean.



* Temperature (T): Reads and displays °C (40.. word).



* Signal (K): Streams signal mV (53.. word); Stop (P) to halt.



* Laser ON (O): Experimental—works on our D8 sometimes (returns ?).



* Push mode (SEND button on device): Leave Confirm push (cfm) ON so the app replies cfm\\n automatically (prevents “240 Data transfer error”).
